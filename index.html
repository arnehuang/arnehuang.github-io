I'm currently living in Toronto and working at <a href = 'www.hubba.com'> Hubba </a> on the Business Technology team.

I'm currently very interested in the field of Human Computer Interfaces - specifically using eye tracking and/or EEG instead of keyboard/mouse.
<br>
Below is me trying to train a neural net to predict left/right mouse movement based on EEG readings, using gaze tracking as input.

Check out my latest work in progress: <a href = 'https://whack-a-vole.herokuapp.com/vole'> a game of "whack a vole" but using webcam based eye-tracking as input. </a>
Clicks calibrate the model so clicking around while stareing purposefully at the cursor will increase accuracy.
