I'm currently living in San Francisco and working at <a href = 'https://www.cruxinformatics.com/'> Crux Informatics </a> as a Data Engineer.

<br>
<br>

I'm currently very interested in the field of Human Computer Interfaces - specifically using eye tracking and/or EEG instead of keyboard/mouse.
<br>
Below is me trying to train a neural net to predict left/right mouse movement based on EEG readings, using gaze tracking as input.
