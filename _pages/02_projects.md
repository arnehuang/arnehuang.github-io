  <h2>Psychology - Directed Forgetting</h2>
  While at the University of Waterloo, I collaborated with Dr. Colin Macleod from the psychology department to dispute <a href = 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2FBF03195325'> a paper </a> concluding that people can intentionally forget things by trying.
  I designed, coded, ran and analyzed two experiments - which to my surprise successfully reproduced the <a href= 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_forgetting#Directed_forgetting'> "directed forgetting"</a> effect. I received an NSERC undergraduate research award for outstanding research ($5000).

  
  <h2>Psychology - Flow in Mind Wandering</h2>
  "Flow" is the state of <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)'> being in the zone</a>.
  For my honours thesis in psychology, I explored whether people experienced Flow in a special situation - when they are Mind Wandering. I wanted to understand why people mind wander - is it because they are chasing this feeling of mental engagement?
  I found two things: first, that yes, people report flow-like characteristics when they are mind wandering. I investigated further and found that people who report more Flow inside mind wandering also deliberately mind wander more often. No one in the world will ever read my <a href = "../thesis.pdf"> thesis </a> but I might as well throw it up here
  
  
  <h2>Statistics/Finance - Stochastic Volatity Model Investigation</h2>
  While at the University of Waterloo, I collaborated with Dr. Martin Lysy from the statistics department to compare different stochastic volatility financial models. These models are very hard to define explicitly, making it difficult to compare them convenentionally.   
  I compared several stochastic volatility models in a likelihood free way, using approximate bayesian computation.  I first simulated Large datasets of 1 year of the S&P 500 from stochastic volatility models (e.g Hestons model,3/2 model, and several other generalizations) using MCMC. I then reduced the large, high dimensional data into a one dimensional distribution, choosing to use a t-distribution of the normalized, differenced data. This distribution is essentially a summary statistic of the model which can be compared. Comparing simulated data to empirical data using standard comparison statistics (Kullbach-Liebler) we unfortunately could not distinguish between simulated and empirical data. However this may be a problem with small sample sizes and limited computational power rather than with the methodology. I received an NSERC undergraduate research award for outstanding research ($5000)
