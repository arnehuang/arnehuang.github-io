  <h2>SVM Modeling</h2>
  While at the University of Waterloo, I collaborated with Dr. Martin Lysy from the statistics department to compare different stochasitc volatility models. These models are very hard to define explicitly, making it difficult to compare them convenentionally. I compared several stochastic volatility models in a likelihood free way, using approximate bayesian computation.  I first simulated large (100k x 252) datasets of 1 year of the S&P 500 from stochastic volatility models such as the Hestons model, the 3/2 model and several generalizations using MCMC. I then reduced the large, high dimensional data into a one dimensional distribution, choosing to use a t-distribution of the normalized, differenced data. This distribution is essentially a summary statistic of the model which can be compared. Comparing simulated data to empirical data using standard comparison statistics (maximum likelihood, Kullbach-Liebler) we could not distinguish between simulated and empirical data. Thoughout the course of this project, I contributed to a custom R package (SVModel). I received an NSERC undergraduate research award for outstanding research ($5000)
  
  <h2>Directed Forgetting</h2>
  While at the University of Waterloo, I collaborated with Dr. Colin Macleod from the psychology department.
  I designed, coded(Python+EPrime), ran and analyzed(R) two experiments - successfully reproducing the directed forgetting effect. The directed forgetting effect suggests that people have the ability to voluntarily forget learned knowledge upon instruction. I received an NSERC undergraduate research award for outstanding research ($5000).
  
  <h2>Flow in Mind Wandering</h2>
  For my honours thesis, I investigated the phenomenon of "Flow". Flow is the state of optimal engagement - a sensation that you have mastery over your tasks, the "alpha" state some call it. 
  I explored whether people experienced flow in a special situation - when they are mind wandering. Using self-report scales I found that indeed, people reported to experience flow-like characteristics during mind wandering. I then further investigated and found that those who more frequently experience flow while mind wandering also seek to deliberately mind wander more often.
