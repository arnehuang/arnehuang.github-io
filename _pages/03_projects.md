  <h2>HCI - Whack A Vole</h2>
  I'm currently working on a game of "whack-a-vole" where one plays with their eyes. You can find my work in progress <a href = 'https://whack-a-vole.herokuapp.com/vole'> here </a>. Clicks calibrate the model so click around the screen while staring purposefully at your mouse cursor (not the hammer). After a while, you should notice that the hammer will start moving to where you are looking, not where you are clicking. 
  
  <h2>Psychology - Directed Forgetting</h2>
  While at the University of Waterloo, I collaborated with Dr. Colin Macleod from the psychology department to dispute <a href = 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2FBF03195325'> a paper </a> concluding that people can intentionally forget things by trying.
  I designed, coded, ran and analyzed two experiments - which to my surprise successfully reproduced the <a href= 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_forgetting#Directed_forgetting'> "directed forgetting"</a> effect. I received an NSERC undergraduate research award for outstanding research ($5000).

  
  <h2>Psychology - Flow in Mind Wandering</h2>
  "Flow" is the state of optimal engagement. When you're In The Zone, maybe playing a sport or a video game or when you're taking a test and you feel like you are doing Exceptionally Well -  that's Flow.
  I explored whether people experienced Flow in a special situation - when they are Mind Wandering. I wanted to understand why people mind wander - is it because they are chasing this fleeting feeling of doing Exceptionally Well in life?
  I found two things: first, that yes, people report flow-like characteristics when they are mind wandering. I investigated further and found that people who report more Flow inside mind wandering also deliberately mind wander more often.   
  
  
  <h2>Statistics/Finance - Stochastic Volatity Model Investigation</h2>
  While at the University of Waterloo, I collaborated with Dr. Martin Lysy from the statistics department to compare different stochastic volatility financial models. These models are very hard to define explicitly, making it difficult to compare them convenentionally.   
  I compared several stochastic volatility models in a likelihood free way, using approximate bayesian computation.  I first simulated Large datasets of 1 year of the S&P 500 from stochastic volatility models (e.g Hestons model,3/2 model, and several other generalizations) using MCMC. I then reduced the large, high dimensional data into a one dimensional distribution, choosing to use a t-distribution of the normalized, differenced data. This distribution is essentially a summary statistic of the model which can be compared. Comparing simulated data to empirical data using standard comparison statistics (Kullbach-Liebler) we could not distinguish between simulated and empirical data. Thoughout the course of this project, I contributed to a custom R package (SVModel). I received an NSERC undergraduate research award for outstanding research ($5000)
