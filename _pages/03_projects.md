  <h2>Flow in Mind Wandering</h2>
  "Flow" is the state of optimal engagement. When you're In The Zone, maybe playing a sport or a video game or when you're taking a test and you feel like you are doing Exceptionally Well -  that's Flow.
  I explored whether people experienced Flow in a special situation - when they are Mind Wandering. I wanted to understand why people mind wander - is it because they are chasing this fleeting feeling of doing Exceptionally Well in life?
  I found two things: first, that yes, people report flow-like characteristics when they are mind wandering. I investigated further and found that people who report more Flow inside mind wandering also deliberately mind wander more often. 
  
  <h2>Stochastic Volatity Model Investigation</h2>
  While at the University of Waterloo, I collaborated with Dr. Martin Lysy from the statistics department to compare different stochastic volatility models. These models are very hard to define explicitly, making it difficult to compare them convenentionally.   
  I compared several stochastic volatility models in a likelihood free way, using approximate bayesian computation.  I first simulated Large datasets of 1 year of the S&P 500 from stochastic volatility models (e.g Hestons model,3/2 model, and several other generalizations) using MCMC. I then reduced the large, high dimensional data into a one dimensional distribution, choosing to use a t-distribution of the normalized, differenced data. This distribution is essentially a summary statistic of the model which can be compared. Comparing simulated data to empirical data using standard comparison statistics (Kullbach-Liebler) we could not distinguish between simulated and empirical data. Thoughout the course of this project, I contributed to a custom R package (SVModel). I received an NSERC undergraduate research award for outstanding research ($5000)
  
  <h2>Directed Forgetting</h2>
  While at the University of Waterloo, I collaborated with Dr. Colin Macleod from the psychology department to investigate whether people can intentionally forget things.
  I designed, coded, ran and analyzed two experiments - successfully reproducing the directed forgetting effect. The directed forgetting effect suggests that people have the ability to voluntarily forget learned knowledge upon instruction. I received an NSERC undergraduate research award for outstanding research ($5000).
