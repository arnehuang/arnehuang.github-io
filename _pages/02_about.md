  <h1> My Skills</h1>
  I use R for analysis, Python and shell scripting for automation, SQL for database interactions and Excel for almost everything.I built this website using Jekyll and Bootstrap.
  
  Things to talk to me about: my data science internship at CMG, the problems I've solved at Citi, or for the technically inclined, ask me what "stochastic volatility models" are and the R packages I've contributed to.
  
  <h1> My Projects</h1>
  <h2>SVM Modeling</h2>
  While at the University of Waterloo, I collaborated with Dr. Martin Lysy from the statistics department. We successfully modeled several stochastic volatility models in R. We then simulated large datasets from these models. Comparing simulated data to empirical data, we found that standard comparison statistics (maximum likelihood, Kullbach-Liebler) could not distinguish between simulated and empirical data. Thoughout the course of this project, I contributed to a custom R package (SVModel). I received an NSERC undergraduate research award for outstanding research ($5000)
  
  <h2>Directed Forgetting</h2>
  While at the University of Waterloo, I collaborated with Dr. Colin Macleod from the psychology department.
  I designed, coded(Python+EPrime), ran and analyzed(R) two experiments - successfully reproducing the directed forgetting effect. The directed forgetting effect suggests that people have the ability to voluntarily forget learned knowledge upon instruction. I received an NSERC undergraduate research award for outstanding research ($5000).
  
  <h2>Flow in Mind Wandering</h2>
  For my honours thesis, I investigated the phenomenon of "Flow". Flow is the state of optimal engagement - a sensation that you have mastery over your tasks, the "alpha" state some call it. 
  I explored whether people experienced flow in a special situation - when they are mind wandering. Using self-report scales I found that indeed, people reported to experience flow-like characteristics during mind wandering. I then further investigated and found that those who more frequently experience flow while mind wandering also seek to deliberately mind wander more often.
