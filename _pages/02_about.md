  <h1> My Skills</h1>
  I use R for analysis, Python and shell scripting for automation, SQL for database interactions and Excel for almost everything.I built this website using Jekyll and Bootstrap.
  
  Things to talk to me about: my data science internship at CMG, the problems I've solved at Citi, or for the technically inclined, ask me what "stochastic volatility models" are and the R packages I've contributed to.
