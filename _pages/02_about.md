  I've got a degree in mathematics from the University of Waterloo where I did a psychology major as well. 
  
  I'm currently very interested in the field of Human Computer Interactions - specifically using eye tracking and/or EEG as inputs to computers instead of the keyboard/mouse. Below is me trying to train a neural net to predict left/right mouse movement based on EEG readings, using gaze tracking as input.

  In my spare time I like to think about a lot of weird things - like the research of <a href="http://www.dbem.ws/FeelingFuture.pdf">Daryl J. Bem</a>, distinguished Cornell professor who for the last 20 years has been trying to prove the existence of pre-cognition.
  
  When I'm not reading obscure psychology studies, I love travelling, thinking about products, and awful music. Here's one of my all time <a href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq_d8VSM0nw">favourites</a>.
