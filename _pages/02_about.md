  I love travelling, awful music and unique foods. Here's one of my all time favourites(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq_d8VSM0nw).
  
  I use R for analysis, Python and shell scripting for automation, SQL for database interactions and Excel for almost everything. I built this website using Jekyll and Bootstrap.
  
  Things to talk to me about: my data science internship at CMG, the problems I've solved at Citi, or for the technically inclined, ask me what "stochastic volatility models" are and the R packages I've contributed to.
