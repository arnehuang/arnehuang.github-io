I don't think vegans are going about solving their problem the right way. 

It's not that the vegan belief is wrong. I think the argument makes sense. Many non-vegans today will agree that animal suffering is bad. 

In 1000 years, we'll probably look back and be disgusted at the barbarism and inefficiency that is human food consumption. 

However, in the present day, many non-vegans tend to agree with statements such as 

"I like the taste of meat" 

or 

"It's just so inconvenient to be a vegan"

_Which is where the vegans should really focus their efforts_.

Worldwide, the global meat industry is [800+ billion USD a year](https://www.statista.com/statistics/502286/global-meat-and-seafood-market-value/). 

In volume, there is about [300 million tonnes](https://ourworldindata.org/meat-and-seafood-production-consumption) of meat produced and consumed annually.

Interestingly, [a few companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat_packing_industry) control nearly all of it (like 4 companies really) but that's a discussion for another time.

Basically, there's a lot of people who like eating meat, and **a lot of people who rely on other people liking eating meat**.

What **realistically** has to happen in order for animals to stop suffering for our food?

When asked, most vegans have never thought about these questions. They think about what they can do. Not what must happen scientifically, economically and socially to solve the problem.

I compare veganism to donating. We all like donating. Giving a dollar to a starving child in Africa _feels good_. 

But suppose that the organization you gave your dollar to is run by a clever con man that takes your money for personal gain instead. You'd feel angry. But if you never knew about the con man, you go about your day. The fact that most people **don't care enough to find out** indicates that they care about the feeling of goodness they get by donating, not about the actual impact their dollar had.

In the vegan case, I think most vegans only care about _feeling good, like they're playing their part and contributing._ They've never actually thought about how to end animal suffering on a global scale.

Scientifically, it doesn't make sense to grow cows to get meat. Cows are meant to be making more cows. For energy that you put into a cow, most of it will be wasted: they grow reproductive organs, they have nerves to avoid pain, they have a whole system that needs energy to make more cows. Not make more meat. Thats why figuring out to to grow meat to get meat will be a game changer. 

If you care about these things, consider checking out companies like [Mosa Meat.](https://www.mosameat.com/) 

At the end of the day, the market has to drive veganism. Economic incentives need to be in place in order to drive the massive change needed to have any sort of impact.
