When friends who live far apart meet up, a common question to ask is 

"How's {_place_}?".

For better or for worse, my response to this question is usually 

"Oh, I've left {_place_}, I'm now in {_new place_}".

I've had 4 jobs in 4 cities since graduating two years ago, an average of 6 months per city. I've worked at a big bank, at a 5 person startup, and companies in between. I've moved countries and continents on a whim.

A  **really fucking smart** guy I used to know wrote about such behaviour as [Thrashing Wildly]( http://sandymaguire.me/blog/thrashing-wildly/). I like it.

I've always had a certain dissatisfaction with my current place in life. 

I remember going into university thinking that I would come out with _options_. I would have grades for credibility. I would have an e-commerce thing for financial independence. I would be socially charming and likeable. Most importantly, if I wasn't something, I would _be able to become it extremely quickly_ - because I had mastered meta-learning.

Part of it is unrealistic goals. I guess I didn't realize that all of these skills are spectrums, not binary. Or that motivation is a thing to account for in my world view. Or that other people can be **really fucking smart**. 

That last point is really where my dissatisfaction comes from. Everytime I see or hear about someone or some group doing some thing that sounds incredible....

I guess what I'm trying to say is it's not that my goals are unrealistic. They just move faster than I do because I keep discovering other people who are **really fucking smart**. So it feels like whatever I'm doing currently is not enough. I'm falling behind.

People talk about the side effects of media and FOMO which I guess has had a pretty profound impact on my life. FOMO makes me dissatisfied. Dissatisfaction makes me Thrash Wildly. 

But I've really enjoyed it. By myself, I would have never been able to push myself. To work on my health. To work on my technical skills. To work on my compassion and kindness. To sharpen and refine my thinking - even about things as abstract as humanity in general. To really try and do something in life.

Recently, I had the conversation described at the beginning of this post with a friend. 

This time, she asked a followup: 

"Why do you move around so much?". 

So yeah, I guess this is the answer. I Thrash Wildly.
