When friends who live far apart meet up and see each other after a while, a common question to ask is "How's {place you're in}?".

For better or for worse, my response to this question is usually "Oh, I've left {place I used to be}, I'm now in {new place I'm in}".

I've had 4 jobs in 4 cities since graduating two years ago, an average of 6 months per city. I've worked at a big bank, at a < 10 person startup, and companies in between. I've moved countries and continents on a whim.

A  *really fucking smart* guy I used to know describeds such behaviour as  <a href = http://sandymaguire.me/blog/thrashing-wildly/>Thrashing Wildly </a>. I like it, I'm stealing it. Thanks Sandy.

I've always had a certain dissatisfaction with my current place in life. 

I remember going into university thinking that I would come out with _options_. I would have a 4.0 GPA, opening doors to industry or academia. I would have an online e-commerce thing for financial independence. I would be socially charming and likeable. Most importantly, if I wasn't something, I would _be able to become it extremely quickly because I had mastered meta-learning_.

I guess I didn't realize that all of these skills are spectrums, not binary. Or that motivation is a thing to account for in my world view. Or that other people can be *really fucking smart*. 

That last point is really where my dissatisfaction comes from. Everytime I see or hear about something or someone....I guess what I'm trying to say is that my goals move faster than I do because I keep discovering other people who are *really fucking smart*.

People talk about the side effects of media and FOMO which I guess has had a pretty profound impact on my life. FOMO makes me dissasisfied. Dissatisfaction makes me Thrash Wildly. 

But I've really enjoyed it. By myself, I would have never been able to push myself. To work on my health. To work on my technical skills. To work on my compassion and kindness. To sharpen and refine my thinking - even about things as abstract as humanity in general. To really try and do something in life.

I had the conversation I described at the beginning of this post recently with a friend. However, this time, she asked a question I don't usually get: "Why do you move around so much?". So yeah, I guess this is the answer. I get FOMO and Thrash Wildly.
