When I message my friends who don't live in the same city, a common question I get asked is 

"How's _place?_ ".

For better or for worse, my response to this question is usually 

"Oh, I've left _place_. I'm now in _new place_ ".

I've had 4 jobs in 4 cities since graduating two years ago, an average of 6 months per city. 

I've moved countries and continents on a whim.

A  guy I used to know wrote about such behaviour. He called it [Thrashing Wildly]( http://sandymaguire.me/blog/thrashing-wildly/). I like it.

I've always had a certain dissatisfaction with my current place in life. 

I remember going into university thinking that I would come out with _options_. 
- I would have grades for credibility. 
- I would have an e-commerce thing for financial independence. 
- I would be socially charming and likeable. 
- Most importantly, if I wasn't something, I would _be able to become it extremely quickly_ - because I had mastered meta-learning.

I made progress.. but I didn't really _nail all of them_.

Part of it is unrealistic goals. I guess I didn't realize that all of these skills are spectrums, not binary. Or that motivation is a thing to account for in my world view. Or that other people can be **really fucking smart**. 

That last point is really where my dissatisfaction comes from. Everytime I see or hear about _{person}_ or _{group}_ doing _{cool thing}_....

I guess what I'm trying to say is it's not that my goals are unrealistic. At least that's not what's causing the dissatisfaction. My goals just move faster than I do because I keep discovering other people who are **really fucking smart**. So it feels like whatever I'm doing currently is not enough. I'm falling behind.

People talk about the side effects of social media and FOMO which I guess have had a pretty profound impact on my life. 

FOMO makes me dissatisfied. 

Dissatisfaction makes me Thrash Wildly.

Recently, I had the conversation described at the beginning of this post with a friend. 

This time, she asked a followup: 

"Why do you move around so much?". 

So yeah, I guess this is the answer. I Thrash Wildly.
