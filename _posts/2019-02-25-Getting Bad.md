Unlike [Getting Good](https://arnehuang.github.io/blog/gettinggood/), Getting Bad is a lot easier. 

By Getting Bad, I mean deterioration. In hard skills, in soft skills, in physiology, in meta skills, in mental patterns....the list goes on.

This probably does boil down to physics in some way - perhaps the brain uses energy to keep certain states and if one state is not useful to preserve, there's some kind of logarithmic decay to reallocate resources.

Regardless of the actual mechanisms of Getting Bad, it feels useful to think about it the way physicists think about Entropy; everything gets worse, unless we put in explicit effort to prevent or reverse this. And it's much more effortful to create then destroy.

This can be depressing in some ways: we're always getting worse at the things we're not explicitly getting better at. 

There's a famous saying among musicians and artists:

[“If I miss one day’s practice, I notice it. If I miss two days’ practice, the critics notice it. If I miss three days’ practice, the public notices it.”](https://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/miss_one_day_of_practice_i_notice_miss_two_the_critics_notice_miss_three_th)

I like to go down this down this line of thinking whenever I'm tempted to skip something that has been routinized (workout, practising, etc). Not only will I not get better, but I'll actually get worse, and (this is another topic) I'll make it easier to skip in the future. The swing or opportunity cost in my head has to be at least doubled when I judging whether it's worth it.
