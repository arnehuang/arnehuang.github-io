2018-09-09 - A woman stopped me on the street. She asked if I was Japanese. I was in a hurry so I said no. She seemed stunned. She said I was very attractive. I said thank you, she said Keep Your Head Up. I walked away...

Keep your head up. Is that because I am head forward hunching like I am insecure? She must have thought I had no reason to do so. 

It boosted my confidence. I felt...sexy. Like a beautiful god deserving of love. 


Confidence is a strange thing. I think that only recently I have mastered it...But in reality, I don't think I have. 

That woman did a great thing. She really had a profound impact on my life. At least for the next hour, she dominated my thoughts making me reflect on who I am and Who I CAN BE. An Actor? I could audtion. A great engineer? A founder? There's so much more to Life. Lets grab it and fucknig own it.


Maybe I've hit too many Dunning Kruegers in the past to know that there's still so many layers and levels to confidence, wit, communication than what I have discovered so far. The gods of media and entertainment have a pizzaz, a hutzpah that I dont have yet. I am not comfortable in certain situations and will avoid being outgoing if I can get away with it. 

One day that might change. 

Confidence needs to come from within. If i rely on external validation....
I'm going to be falterable.
