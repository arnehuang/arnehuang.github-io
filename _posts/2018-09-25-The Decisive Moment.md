I work out Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. On these days I almost always _want_ to go exercise after work but sometimes I ended up not going and doing other things instead. Thankfully today I did end up working out.

It's always interesting and not entirely clear to me _when and how_ that decision to skip a workout gets made. 

I'm going to trace a timeline of my day and ask myself at certain points _"When did I make the decision to workout?"_


__5:25pm - It's not made when I'm at the gym__. I have a pretty good track record of working out _when I'm already at the gym_. I've never just gone to the gym and not worked out. The decision was made before I got to the gym.

__5:15pm - It's not made when I'm headed to the gym__. I have a pretty good track record of ending up at the gym when I'm going to the gym. I've never headed for the gym, then suddenly had a change of heart and veered off to do something else. As being at the gym means working out, the decision to work out was thus made before I headed for the gym.

So far so good. It looks like if I'm on route to the gym, I'll end up working out 100% of the time. Now here's where things get a little hairy... 

__7:00am - 5:00pm - It's not made during the work day__. If you ask me if "Are you going to work out" when I wake up in the morning, I'll most likely answer "Yes". Even if you ask me at 4:00pm, I've answered "Yes" but ended up not going to the gym. Answers during this time slot really are not predictive of whether I _actually_ work out. So I'll say that my decision has not been made yet during the work day.

__So the decision is made some time after I finish working but before I'm headed somewhere__.

---

Let's break that down:

__It's not made if I've physically left the building__. I've made up my mind about what is next at this point. This could count as on the way to the gym, if that's what has been decided.

__It's not made if I'm in the elevator__. Again, by the time I'm in the elevator I've made up my mind about what is next.

__It's not made if I'm packing up__. By the time I'm gathering my stuff I again feel like I've already made up my mind.

__It's made when I've decided I'm done work for the day__. 

There's a weird moment I get at the end of the day when I've decided, "day's over". Once that decision has been made, my brain automatically gets triggered to think about what's next....and that's really when I decide if I pack up with the intention of going to the gym.

I'm trying to break down what happens in my head now in these moments. It's hard to describe, and probably tainted by all kinds of biases, but here it is. Random things pop into my head. It's like the culmination of all relevant (and irrelevant) facts from the last hour...day...even month come into my head at once:

- "Oh, you're feeling extra tired today"

- "You didn't get enough sleep last night"

- "Abs"

- "You're on a X day streak, don't break it"

- "I wonder if that cute girl will be doing those diagonal lunges today"

- "Doing Y activity sounds like fun. Let's do that instead"

- "The gym smells so bad"

- "Logistic regression is interesting"

- "You've worked out for 8 weeks in a row now, didn't you read somewhere you should have a rest week?"

- "Women are more attracted to men when ovulating"

And I don't make a pros and cons list or anything. These facts just float in and out of consciousness, faster than I can be aware of, and suddenly, a decision will be made. In like 2-5 seconds. I don't know how. I do know it's a lot of different things that affect me in that instant. A cumulation of many factors. Small, critical, invisible. But its thoughts I'm not fully aware of during and definitely not aware of after. It's unfortunate humans don't have a big nice dashboard in their head showing them all of the factors contributing to a decision at the moment.

Before this moment, if you ask me "Are you working out today?" _any answer you get is unreliable_. After this moment, I get a sense of _sureness_ and looking back (selective memory, yada yada) I don't think I've deviated from whatever decision is made after that instant.

Just being more and more aware of "the moment" has improved my odds of working out. It does feel like I can build reinforcements and backups to help sway the decision of the moment. There's some hacky stuff I've explored, such as thoughts like "You can go to the gym and just sit there and watch videos on your phone". I know I'll never actually go to the gym and not work out so as long as I _pack up with the gym as my intent_... I can tell myself I _could_ just watch videos but I'll probably end up working out instead. 

It _feels_ like these things help, but who knows, it's such a huge mystery what happens in that moment that I really can't say. My workout app says I'm more consistent now, but like my old statistics professor used to say, just because there's more shark attacks, it doesn't mean it's caused by ice cream sales.

This is really a general pattern to doing a lot of things in my life. There's a critical moment when a lot of factors leading up to the moment start exerting their influence consciously or subconsciously and somehow a decision ends up popping out and that's that. I don't notice that something just _happened_ but it has. And so I end up doing or not doing that extra course online or that looking into that extra tax implication or reading that new book. 

How strange.
