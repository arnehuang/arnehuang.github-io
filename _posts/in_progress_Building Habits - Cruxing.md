Thesis:
Habits have a Crux (in rock climbing terms)

eg
If i'm in the gym its unlikely i just sit around
if i'm walking to the gym its unlikely i don't go to the gym
if i'm leaving by office with my bag making up my mind to go to the gym
if I'm at my office Its....now likely i dont go to the gym
....
If i'm in my bed in the morning and I DONT think i'm going to the gym today.... it's now very likely I don't go to the gym. 

Decisions are not made in an instant.

To build new habits, identify cruxes. Identify ways to preserve will power. Use high will power patterns to help through low will power times
