Sometimes when I read writings by people who are in my eyes "good" in their field, like [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html), I get depressed at how articulate...and overall how _Good_ they are at what they're talking about. 

Were they always this good? Did they sweep all their earlier writings under the rug and only post Good things? Or did they just not have low quality writing to begin with? Are they retroactively editing their posts?

Paul Graham's essays date back to 1990's and I find them especially impactful, even now 25 years later in 2018. I find myself thinking, if he was that _good_ then, imagine what he must be like now. 

I look back at some of my writing I've put out in the past few months and I actually cringe and shudder. I don't know how to improve it. But I do know I'm very very far from being good, at least at writing.  

In my quest to  _get Good_, I don't feel like I've made much progress. Perhaps it's because most of my time in recent years has been invested in soft skill development which is harder to track. In any case, I feel I'm not making progress fast enough because I see and hear stories of what other, younger people have achieved.

Which leads me to the idea of getting meta-good, or good at getting good. My previous model of getting good was loosely as follows: 
goodness is exponentially increasing if knowledge is publically available - people get faster at getting good as they get more good. Then, there's a point where they hit the peak of shared human knowledge of that topic, at which point they slow down.

In this model, we all eventually even out and catch up to the "Goods" given enough time.

But I now think my model isn't true at all. For instance, people have to realize that knowledge in their field is out there to consume. They have to be motivated to consume it. They have to find it. And they have to balance studying the theory versus actually practising it.

I think I'm actually very bad at being meta-good. I have no motivation to study (or think deeply about) the theory of how to write better, but I'll spend hours writing awful garbage, improving extremely slowly. Sadface.

This is an awful meta-good habit I've noticed across nearly all aspects of my life. Gym? I'll go work out 4 hours a week but won't spend 30 minutes getting better at working out. Cooking? I'll cook crap a million times but never learn any culinary theory. 

I postulate that being meta-good is a skill some people can developing much faster than others. If this is true, it leads to a very depressing possibility that no matter how hard you try you'll never be as good as someone. In fact, the gap between you and them _actually increases_, even if you're trying 100%, because they simply get better faster.

It's also inspirational in some ways.
