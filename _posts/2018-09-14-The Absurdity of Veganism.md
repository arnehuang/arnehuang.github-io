If everyone in the world became a vegan today, there would be __catastrophic__ consequences.

It's not that the vegan rational is all wrong... At the core of it, the spirit of the argument makes sense. Many non-vegans today will even agree that at some point how much an animal suffers outweighs the inconvenience of not eat it. 

In 1000 years, we'll probably look back and be disgusted at the barbarism  that is human food consumption. 

However, in the present day, many non-vegans tend to agree with statements such as 

"I like meat" 

or 

"It's just so inconvenient to be a vegan"

_Which is where the vegans should really focus their efforts_.

Worldwide, the global meat industry is [800+ billion USD a year](https://www.statista.com/statistics/502286/global-meat-and-seafood-market-value/). 

In volume, there is about [300 million tonnes](https://ourworldindata.org/meat-and-seafood-production-consumption) of meat produced and consumed annually.

Interestingly, [a few companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat_packing_industry) control nearly all of it (like 4 companies really) but that's a discussion for another time.

Basically, there's a lot of people who like eating meat, and **a lot of people who rely on other people liking eating meat**.

Let's suppose, next Thursday, everyone had a change of heart for the poor animals.

Everyone stopped eating meat. 

A lot of people would be very very upset. 

A lot of bad things would happen. 

- Farmers, whose lives depend on raising livestock are suddenly financially destitute. 

- Also, their animals, with no purpose, would be everywhere. 

- Financial markets are shocked as protein alternatives suddenly become extremely valuable, while meat crashes. 

- Countries and citizens start stockpiling for fear of famine. 

- Soon, dead animals everywhere. 

- The vast amount of misinformation and ignorance currently floating around regarding proper nutrition causes widespread malnutrition. 

- A massive global food crisis.

... and so on and so forth

<br/>

The end result that vegans claim to want would probably end up killing humans in the place of the animals. 

It's really the _suddenness_ that does us in. 

We are just not prepared for too many vegans.

There are two common responses to my example that I usually get from vegan acquaintances.

<br/>

Some people don't like the example. They respond with something like 

"Well of course it wouldn't happen all at once. We would have a transition period so that people can adjust."

But _how?_ 

One day we wake up... are we going to systematically start assigning people dates on which they can't eat meat anymore? How much buffer time in the transition period would we need? It can't be indefinite - nothing would change then. Who's going to coordinate all this? 

**What specifically has to happen in order for animals to stop suffering?** 

When asked, most people have never thought about these questions.

<br/>


Despite my best efforts to approach this topic with neutrality and curiosity, some people still feel attacked by my example. They often respond with something along the lines of: 

"I'm not saying _you_ have to be vegan. I'm saying I do it because it's what I _believe_ in."

Sure, but you claim that to be vegan because you believe it reduces suffering. 

It seems that you're introducing human suffering... 
- in the farmers that grow the livestock you refuse to eat
- in the financial markets that run less efficiently because they expect you to eat meat
- in your friends who - being accepting and understanding - go out of their way to cook...

We all like donating. Giving a dollar to a starving child in Africa _feels good_. 

But suppose that the organization you gave your dollar to is run by a clever con man that takes your money for personal gain instead. You'd feel cheated. Angry. All sorts of indignant. 

But if you never knew....

The fact that most people don't care enough to find out indicates that they care about the feeling of goodness they get by donating, not about the actual impact their dollar had.

In the vegan case, the common responses indicate that most vegans only care about _feeling good, like they're playing their part and contributing._ They've never actually thought about how to end animal suffering on a global scale. They've never thought about how their actions impact human suffering.

More and more of my vegan friends are trying to make impacts in more efficient ways. If you care about the cause, consider donating time or effort to spreading awareness for companies like [Mosa Meat.](https://www.mosameat.com/)

At the end of the day, the market has to drive veganism. Economic incentives need to be in place in order to drive the massive change needed to have any sort of impact.
