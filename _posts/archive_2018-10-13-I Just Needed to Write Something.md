When I started out, I set a goal to write a post once a week. I haven't been able to stay consistent in that and it sucks. For me, willpower is a multifaceted phenomenon affecting many areas of my life. In this case, not writing blog posts consistently has been decreasing my confidence in my ability to stay on track in other areas of life. 

I've also noticed I haven't been doing what I say I will do (to myself) as often in the past few weeks. I came across an interesting article about 2-3 weeks ago and I've just been pushing and pushing reading the article back in my calendar. I need to check on my benefits claims. I need to check on my nexus application. All of these things that can be done in a few minutes...I've just been pushing them off...

I've stopped thinking about things with logic such as "Is there a benefit to doing this later?" and "If I really want to get this done the probablity only goes down if I delay. "

I'm going to go read those articles right now.

I ended up not reading those articles but I did do most of the other errands. We'll see what happens tomorrow.
